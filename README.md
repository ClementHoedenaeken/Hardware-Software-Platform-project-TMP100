# Hardware_Software_Platform_project_TMP100
Repository containing all the explanations and codes of the project of the course of Hardware/Software Platforms. 

Hi! 👋
We are two students of the Faculty of Engineering of the university of Mons ([UMONS](https://web.umons.ac.be/en/)). We are currently (2020-2021) in the 1st year of our master's degree and we are in the finality *Electrical Energy and Smart Grids*. 



For our course of *Hardware/Software Platforms* we have to implement the interface between a sensor and a computer through an FPGA. This repository will soon contain a lots of information explaining our work 📚.

We choosed a temperature sensor 🌡️ which will be connected to an FPGA through an **I²C** bus. 

Feel free to contact us for more explanations about this project :
