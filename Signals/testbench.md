This file contains the results of our testbench. The aim af a testbench is to simulate the project before actually uploading it on an FPGA. 

The following figures show that our circuit reproduces well what is needed to configure the sensor and start a reading (cfr datasheet of the sensor). The SDA and SCL signals generated correspond to those supplied in the datasheet. The sensor should then work as expected.
